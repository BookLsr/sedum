  "readme": "# css-select-base-adapter\n\nProvides some base functions needed by a \n[`css-select`](https://github.com/fb55/css-select) adapter so that you don't\nhave to implement the whole thing.\n\n## usage\n\n`npm install css-select-base-adapter --save`\n\n```javascript\nvar baseAdapter = require('css-select-base-adapter');\n\nvar myAdapter = {\n  // your partial implementation here\n};\n\n// get an adapter with everything needed by css-select\nvar adapter = baseAdapter(myAdapter);\n\n// use adapter with css-select...\n```\n\n## how it works\n\nAn adapter for `css-select` requires the following functions to be implemented:\n\n```\nisTag, existsOne, getAttributeValue, getChildren, getName, getParent,\ngetSiblings, getText, hasAttrib, removeSubsets, findAll, findOne\n```\n\nYou can pass this module a more minimal implementation and it will return a full \nadapter that fills in any missing functions, provided that you implement at \nleast:  \n\n```\nisTag, getAttributeValue, getChildren, getName, getParent, getText\n```\n\nIf you provide any of the other methods required of an adapter, the base adapter \nwill use your implementation instead of its own.\n\nSee the \n[`css-select` readme](https://github.com/fb55/css-select/blob/master/README.md)\nfor more information on the required function signatures.\n\n## license\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 Nik Coughlin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
